# Interactive component

In the last section, we analyzed payment choices over a variety of factors using data in 2019. Now, we are interested in how these correlations change over time. We will focus on the correlation between age and payment choices. In this section, we utilize D3 to build an interactive stacked bar plot. Each plot shows the change of payment choices in a certain age group. You can click on the button at the upper right corner to switch to different age groups. You can also hover over the colored blocks in the graph to highlight that specific payment type. This interactive presentation is more clear and convenient to view than facets.

We can see that from 2015 to 2019, paper payments like cash and checks became less popular among most groups.
