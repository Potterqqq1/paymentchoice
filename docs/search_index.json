Payment methods can be influenced by many factors. Some merchants take cash only, and some transactions can only be done through online payments. It takes time for the public to get used to new payment methods. Understanding how people decide payment methods helps governments make economic plans and help merchants improve the customer shopping experience. In this project, we used annual diaries of consumer payment choice data sets for six years from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. We explored how the features of consumers and transactions affect payment types. We also demonstrated how payment instrument preferences change over time. "],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources", " Chapter 2 Data sources All group members collected a range of data sets. Among all the data sets collected, we chose the one from the Federal Bank of Atlanta (https://www.frbatlanta.org/banking-and-payments/consumer-payments/diary-of-consumer-payment-choice/?panel=2). Under Diaries tab, there are datasets about consumer payment choices for six different years. In each diary, under the Data Sets tab, there are three public-use data sets, Day-level, Individual-level, and Transaction-level. We used Individual-level and Transaction-level data sets for each year. The Individual-level data set records anonymous individuals’ payment choices and some of their economic conditions, such as income and age. The Transaction-level data set records payment types and transaction-related information such as time in a day and merchant types. The two data sets contain 15095 rows and 111 columns, and 3016 rows and 129 columns respectively. We chose these two data sets because they have columns that record payment types used in transactions and payment types consumers prefer in various conditions. With over 200 features, the data sets are very informative. A drawback is that some categorical values in the data sets are recorded as digits. We need to refer to another file, the Data Codebook PDF file, in the diary to understand what each digit represents. "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation", " Chapter 3 Data transformation We picked only the columns that will appear in our plots. For the first group of graphs, the correlation between individual features and payment instrument preferences, we selected the preferred payment instruments for bill payment, income-related properties, age, and education level. The values of education levels and payment preferences were transformed from digits to actual meanings. For example, 1 in education level is now “Less than 1st grade”. Here are the first five records of the transformed data. ## paypref_b1 income_hh homeowner home_value home_debt ## 1 Credit card 140000 1 330000 230000 ## 2 Online banking bill payment 50000 0 NA NA ## 3 Check 61000 1 220000 184000 ## 4 Online banking bill payment 50000 1 183000 0 ## 5 Check 25000 1 350000 0 ## other_assets other_debts gender age highest_education ## 1 100000 0 1 36 Masters degree ## 2 5000 8000 1 29 High school or GED ## 3 0 24000 1 70 Some college/no degree ## 4 5000 500 0 58 Bachelors degree ## 5 5000 0 0 61 Some college/no degree The second group of graphs is about the correlation between transaction time, merchant type, and payment type. The data is from the Transaction-level data set. We changed the values in the time column from actual time into time intervals (4 hours each). We also transformed the digits into the real meanings in the merchant type column. Here is a sample cleaned data from group 2. ## merch payment_instrument time_interval ## 1 4 Cash 04:00-08:00 ## 2 2 Credit card 04:00-08:00 ## 3 NA &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; ## 4 15 Debit card 00:00-04:00 ## 5 4 Cash 08:00-12:00 The last group is about how devices influence consumer’s payment instrument preferences. The data is from the Individual-level data set. We calculated the number of credit cards and debit cards each individual holds by the number of non-null values in the five credit card type columns. We also represented how much do individuals prefer credit cards, debit cards, and mobile payments. The extent is measured by counting the occurrences of each instrument among preferences in five different transaction amounts. Here is a sample of group 3 data. ## cc cr dc sonline prefcc prefdc prefm ## 1 1 1 1 1 4 1 0 ## 2 1 1 1 0 0 5 0 ## 3 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 ## 4 1 1 1 1 4 0 0 ## 5 1 1 1 1 0 4 0 "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values", " Chapter 4 Missing values We divided the missing values into three parts, reflecting missing data in each group of graphs. The first group contains data of preferred instrument for bill payment, age, income, house value, assest, debt and educational level. There is a high probability that observations with income_hh missing have home_value, home_debt, other_assets, and other_debts missing. Perhaps they are people with unstable income and rent houses to live in. There are only 40 out of 3016 observations that have NA household income. So we just delete them. From the first plot, we can see that a large portion of homeowners left the house debit and value blank. This information might be considered quite private. The second group is the columns of time, payment type, and merchant type of transactions from the Transaction-level data set. The missing values could be a result of cash transactions. When paying by cash, the accurate time of transaction is hard to measure. Also, some merchants do not keep track of cash transactions but all electronic transactions will be automatically recorded. The last group is preferred payment choices of consumers for transactions in six different conditions: under $10, $10 to $25, $25 to $50, $50 to $100, over $100, and online. Also, the credit card types and rewards, and debit card types and rewards. From the plot, we can see that most people do not hold more than one credit card. Debit cards are more common than credit cards. It is reasonable since many teenagers are not eligible to apply for credit cards. Also, we can see that in most records, credit card and credit card rewards miss together. Therefore, most credit cards may come with rewards. "],["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Part I. Payment choice and Individual features 5.2 Part II. Payment type and Transaction features 5.3 Part III. Cardholders and their preferences", " Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Part I. Payment choice and Individual features The individual background will highly likely influence their behaviors, including payment instrument preferences. We selected three features from the data sets to analyze, income, age, and educational level. Below is a stacked bar chart that shows the correlation between paying habits and income level. We standardized the data at each income level to better present every group’s preferences. In the graph, we used instrument preference of bill payment. Bill payment is the regular reception of compensation for a repeated service, like rent. The graph shows a decreasing trend in cash payments and debit card payments as the income level go up. The wealthier groups tend to use credit cards and online banking bill payments more often. Besides these instruments, check and bank account number payment are also popular among all groups. These differences could be a result of different bill types, bill amounts, and merchants. For example, it is more likely to pay small amounts of bills with cash. The next graph indicates the payment preferences of different age groups. Similarly, we used bill payment preferences and standardized the data for better presentation. The result shows that payment preference does change along with age group. Cash and debit card payments are negatively correlated with age, while there is a clear positive correlation between online banking. Overall, the elders use checks more often. The general trend is similar to the last graph. A reason could be the elders are usually wealthier. A new discovery is that Paypal is more popular among teenagers. The third graph is about preferences among people of different educational levels. An outlier is the Under 1st-grade group, which only uses debit cards. The population of that group is very small so that group is not very informative. There is an overall decreasing trend in cash and debit card payments, and increasing popularity of credit card and online banking bill payments as the educational level go up. The educational level also has a certain influence on income level. Therefore, the trends are similar. From the three stacked bar plots, we can see that cash, cards, online banking, and checks are the most popular instruments for all groups. Credit cards are more popular in the elder, higher educated, and wealthier groups while debit card and cash payments show the opposite trend. People in wealthier, elder and higher educated groups are more likely to have high-level credit cards and more access to online banking payments. 5.2 Part II. Payment type and Transaction features After exploring the payment preference of various consumer groups. We want to see how people actually pay in different transactions. In Part II, we analyze how transaction time and merchant types affect payment instruments. The first heatmap shows the correlation between transaction time in a day and paying method. We can see that most transactions happen in the daytime from 8 am to 8 pm. The most popular instruments are cash, credit card, and debit card. Check is not as popular as in Part I because we counted in daily payments, which are hardly done through checks. To better present how payment instruments change over time intervals, we standardized the data over each time interval in the next plot. The heatmap demonstrates that there are changes in payment methods in different time intervals. Although generally cash and cards are the most popular, bank account number payment and online banking bill payment are as common from 00:00 to 04:00. A large portion of stores is closed at that time. Also, there can be a large impact from online shopping in this time interval. The third graph presents the correlation between payment methods and merchant types. The data is standardized over payment types. Merchant types presented as digits in the graph. The detailed merchant types are right below the heatmap. Merchant number meaning: 1 - Grocery stores, convenience stores without gas stations, pharmacies 2 - Gas stations 3 - Sit-down restaurants and bars 4 - Fast food restaurants, coffee shops, cafeterias, food trucks 5 - General merchandise stores, department stores, other stores, online shopping 6 - General services: hair dressers, auto repair, parking lots, laundry or dry cleaning, etc. 7 - Arts, entertainment, recreation 8 - Utilities not paid to the government: electricity, natural gas, water, sewer, trash, heating oil 9 - Taxis, airplanes, delivery 10 - Telephone, internet, cable or satellite tv, video or music streaming services, movie theaters 11 - Building contractors, plumbers, electricians, HVAC, etc. 12 - Professional services: legal, accounting, architectural services; veterinarians; photographers or photo processers 13 - Hotels, motels, RV parks, campsites 14 - Rent for apartments, homes, or other buildings, real estate companies, property managers, etc. 15 - Mortgage companies, credit card companies, banks, insurance companies, stock brokers, IRA funds, mutual funds, credit unions, sending remittances 16 - Can be a gift or repayment to a family member, friend, or co-worker. Can be a payment to somebody who did a small job for you. 17 - Charitable or religious donations 18 - Hospital, doctor, dentist, nursing homes, etc. 19 - Government taxes or fees 20 - Schools, colleges, childcare centers 21 - Public transportation and tolls The heatmap shows a clear correlation between payment methods and merchant types. People tend to use cash on small-amount payments and hardly on large transactions such as hotels and flight tickets. Credit cards are more popular for daily expenses like dinner or travels than for formal bills like tuition and taxes. Checks have the opposite properties to credit cards; they are used to pay for formal bills rather than frequent payments. Online banking and bank account payments are similar to checks except that they are less common than checks in in-person payment situations like donations and hospital bills. We can see those card payments are the most commonly used among all groups of people and in all transaction situations. Therefore, we will specifically focus on card payments in Part III. 5.3 Part III. Cardholders and their preferences In this part, we will explore how much do cardholders prefer paying by cards, how many cards do they have and how much rewards they get from the cards. The data is from the Individual-level data set. We calculated the number of credit cards and debit cards each individual holds by the number of non-null values in the five credit card type columns. We also represented how much do individuals prefer credit cards, debit cards, and mobile payments. The extent is measured by counting the occurrences of each instrument among preferences in five different transaction situations, $10, $10 to $25, $25 to $50, $50 to $100, and over $100. The first mosaic plot presents the correlation between the number of credit cards and cardholder’s preference on paying by credit cards. Credit card holders like paying by credit cards more. Consumers with a preference level of 5 increase with the number of credit cards held while people with level 0 preference decreases. However, the other levels of preference do not have an obvious trend. It is noteworthy that most people have only one credit card. In this group, almost half of consumers do not prefer credit card for daily payments at all. Almost no consumer never prefer credit cards in the 5 credit cards group. In the next graph, we will do the same exploration on debit cards. It is interesting how half of people with no debit card prefer paying by debit card. We can see an overall increasing trend of level 0 preference and level 5 preference decreases as number of debit card increase. Debit cards preference shows an opposite trend to credit cards’. The reason could be that debit cards usually come with less rewards than credit cards or no reward at all. Therefore, we will see how much people prefer credit cards and the number of credit cards with reward they hold. We get a very close result to the graph “Preferences on Credit Cards vs Number of Credit Cards”. It indicates that almost all credit cards come with rewards. People with multiple debit cards are likely to have multiple credit cards. Therefore, since credit cards and debit cards are equally convenient, it is understandable that cardholders prefer credit cards more when they have multiple and prefer debit cards less. In the last plot, we explored the popularity of new payment method, mobile payments. We compared the preference level between online shoppers and consumers who never shopped online. We can see that most people have online shoppoing experience. It is evident that online shoppers prefer mobile payment much more than those who never shop online. There is a noteworthy difference on people with level 5 preference. "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 6 Interactive component", " Chapter 6 Interactive component "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 7 Conclusion", " Chapter 7 Conclusion We analyzed the effect of individual factors and transaction situations on payment choices. It is exciting that payment preferences can be influenced by so many features. However, due to the unbalanced data, it is hard to analyze the influence of certain factors over the payment choices at the exploratory level. For example, in the stacked bar plots, most payment types are hard to see due to the limited records. For improvements, we can collect more data or build separate graphs for the payment types with limited records. Through this project, we learned that graph choice is crucial. When a graph has no obvious information, another kind of plot will have a stunning different result. Also, when a graph shows no obvious correlation, we can still find useful information from it.
